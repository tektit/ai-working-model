# Troubleshooting

Known failures, keyed by the exact error text a person or an agent
sees. Search here before forming a hypothesis ("Verify before
declaring ready" in
[principles/ai-working-process.md](principles/ai-working-process.md)):

```sh
grep -n -i -F "<a distinctive part of the error text>" docs/troubleshooting.md
```

An entry is added once its fix is verified, in the change that
verifies it. Entries are never deleted: one whose cause was fixed
upstream is marked resolved upstream, with the version, because the
same error comes back with an older version. A lesson worth knowing
before anyone hits it belongs with the project's other facts (see
`AGENTS.md`); this page starts from the error.

## Index
