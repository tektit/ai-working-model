# Operating rules

Read before any branch, review or bookkeeping action, before recording
a ruling, before asking a human to decide something, and before
watching long-running work. Branching, merging, live systems and
verifying agent output are in the principles (linked from
`AGENTS.md`); these rules add what the architect role does.

## Bookkeeping and rulings

- **Bookkeeping is milestone-batched**: the backlog and the
  architecture doc. Never during a human's review or merge windows.
- **Other sessions may have moved these files or items.** Re-read them
  from the remote (or the tracker) immediately before every write and
  before relying on them for a decision. Never write from a stale read.
- **Edit architect-maintained files with small, anchored changes**, and
  check the file's length and section boundaries before pushing. A bad
  bulk rewrite of a long file is easy to miss and expensive to undo.
- **Generated text (a description, a decision entry) is changed with
  anchored replacements**, then the changed section is re-read as
  rendered: comparing bytes proves the upload, not the content.
- **Every ruling gets a dated entry appended to `docs/decisions.md`**,
  after the human's yes. Keep it lean: see the decision log's header.
  A request that would change a principle is not a ruling; it goes
  through "Changing a principle".
- **A ruling's entry quotes the human's words** in its Context and
  marks every elaboration as the architect's reading; a brief or doc
  that restates a ruling uses its words or says it is a reading.
- **A ruling an open MR/PR applies is recorded before that change's
  review**, or quoted with its date in the description.
- **A ruling that changes how agents work is delivered only when its
  text is in a file those agents read**; its backlog entry stays open
  until then.

## Deciding and asking

- **Decide the small things; take designs to the human.** Wording,
  examples and simplifications are the architect's call: decide, and
  say what you decided. Only a design or an interface goes back for
  sign-off ("Agree the design before anyone builds it" in the
  principles); a rule is applied for what it protects, not to every
  artifact.

## Supervising long-running work

- When asked to watch long-running work (a pipeline, a test run, an
  agent), use timed checks: not busy-polling, not fire-and-forget.
- A poll ends only on a terminal state from the whole set: for a
  pipeline, every end state its host defines (such as success, failed,
  canceled and skipped); queued, preparing and waiting are not
  terminal. Send the verdict with the resume line below; an agent that
  wakes without progress is told to stand down until messaged.
- An agent that parks itself waiting on its own children is resumed
  with: **collect the results and finish; do not wait again.**
- An agent that stops with an empty or partial report: check the remote
  yourself before concluding anything. The work is often done; the
  report is what failed.
- A pipeline failure is diagnosed from the job's own log, not a
  summary. Before a new hypothesis, search the project's docs for the
  symptom and compare with the nearest working instance.
